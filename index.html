                <p>Oracle APEX App Builder User’s Guide describes how to use the Oracle APEX development environment to build and deploy database-centric 
                    web applications. Oracle APEX turns a single Oracle database into a shared service by enabling multiple workgroups to build and access 
                    applications as if they were running in separate databases.</p>
                <h4>Audience</h4>
                <p>Oracle APEX App Builder User’s Guide is intended for application developers who are building database-centric web applications using 
                    Oracle APEX. The guide describes how to use the Oracle APEX development environment to build, debug, manage, and deploy applications.</p>
                <p>To use this guide, you must have a general understanding of relational database concepts and an understanding of the operating system 
                    environment under which you run Oracle APEX.</p>

                <h4>Diversity and Inclusion</h4>
                <code>Oracle is fully committed to diversity and inclusion. Oracle respects and values having a diverse workforce that increases thought 
                    leadership and innovation. As part of our initiative to build a more inclusive culture that positively impacts our employees, customers, 
                    and partners, we are working to remove insensitive terms from our products and documentation. We are also mindful of the necessity to 
                    maintain compatibility with our customers' existing technologies and the need to ensure continuity of service as Oracle's offerings and 
                    industry standards evolve. Because of these technical constraints, our effort to remove insensitive terms is ongoing and will take time 
                    and external cooperation.</code>

                <p>To efficiently use App Builder, developers must understand some key concepts including managing user interface design, viewing rendered 
                    application pages, understanding page processing and rendering, managing session state, understanding URL syntax, managing session state 
                    values, and using built-in substitution strings.</p>

                <p>Developers use App Builder to create and manage applications and application pages.</p>
                <code>The App Builder home page displays all installed applications in the current Oracle APEX instance. When a developer selects an 
                    application to edit, the Application home page appears. Use the Application home page to run, edit, import, export, copy, or delete 
                    applications.</code>

                <header id="header_creating_apps">Creating Applications</header>
                <p>An application is a collection of pages linked together using navigation menus, tabs, buttons, or hypertext links. Application pages share 
                    a common session state and authentication.</p>
                <p>To create an application, a developer runs wizards to declaratively assemble pages and navigation. Individual pages are organized using 
                    containers called regions. Once created, developers can modify an application by editing application attributes and add new pages using 
                    the Create Page Wizard. Developers can further manage the development process by creating page groups, locking and unlocking pages, 
                    adding developer and application comments, and accessing a variety of application, page, and cross page utilities and reports.</p>
